                         
                    Life Without You

                 by Stevie Ray Vaughan
              from his album "Soul to Soul"

PRELIMINARY NOTES:
SRV tuned down one half-step, so his E, A, D, G, B and E 
strings were at Eb, Ab, Gb, Gb, Db, and Eb, respectively.  
The chords listed here take this into account... that is, 
you must lower them all by one half-step or tune your guitar 
down by a half-step in order to duplicate the pitches on his 
recording.

STYLISTIC NOTES:  This song, more than any other (I think), 
shows the influence that Jimi Hendrix had on SRV.  So, 
before you play this song, I recommend that you do a little 
outside listening, specifically a lot of Hendrix, preferably 
"Little Wing" and "Bold as Love" in order to get the feel of 
this tune.  You might also try listening to SRV's cut of 
"Little Wing."  It would be possible for me to tab out all 
of the little intricacies of the tune, but there's nothing 
*special* in it... that is, these little licks are all over 
Stevie Ray's and Jimi's tunes.  [Note:  For a more 
contemporary example of these licks in action, listen to 
Pearl Jam's "Yellow Leadbetter" (sp?)].

Anyway, here's my transcription of the tune (Please forgive 
any lyric mistakes I have made).  Enjoy!  (April '95)

TRANSCRIPTION NOTES:
Since there are three distinctive voicings of the E chord 
used in this song, I've listed all three of them and 
identified them separately as E1, E2 and E3.  These names 
have no meaning outside of this transcription:  these chords 
are all E major chords, but for this, they should be played 
in the voicings I indicate.
