Verse 1   ( Intro D+)
                   G
Riding along in my automobile

My baby beside me at the wheel
                                C
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
                     G
my curiosity running wild
                         D
crusin' and playin' the radio
                            G
with no particular place to go

Verse 2
                   G
Riding along in my automobile

I's anxious to tell her the way I feel
                         C
So I told her softly and sincere
                                   G
and she leaned and whispered in my ear
                          D
cuddlin' more and drivin' slow
                            G
with no particular place to go

Verse 3
                       G
No particular place to go

So we parked way out on ko-ko-mo
                                     C
The night was young and the moon was gold
                             G
So we both decided to take a stroll
                         D
Can you image the way I felt
                               G
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt

Verse 4
                   G
Riding along in my calaboose

Still trying to get her belt a-loose
                          C
all the way home I held a grudge
                                   G
for the safety belt that wouldn't budge
                         D
Crusin' and playing the radio
                            G
with no particular place to go
