        Am
Are you thrilled with a room full of mirrors,


All I could see was me,


Then I take my spirit and smash my mirrors,

            F              G              Am
And now the whole world is here for me to see,

          F               G             Am
I say the whole world is here for me to see,

         F                G      Am
Now I'm searching for my love to be.....etc etc.
